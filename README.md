## Overview

QZedStat is a fork of the QDirStat ((c) 2015 Stefan Hundhammer <Stefan.Hundhammer@gmx.de> ) program
with a slightly different focus. It leverages many of the existing features of qDirStat (Directory scanning,
file type identification by filename suffix, graphical representaion of file tree structure) to drive source 
code analysis tools.

The cleanup features of qDirStat have been removed. Since full file tree access on *nix systems generally
requires elevated permissions, it was deemed safer to disable these features than to attempt to add safety checks
to all the possible cleanup actions that can be configured in the original program.

The Mime configuration categories have been 'hijacked' to segregate and identify source code files related to particular
programming languages. The file suffix defaults that are hard coded are the result of an attempt to maintain
some compatability with some of the other open-source code analysis utilities available.


## Under Construction .....

The remainder of this page is currently under construction... references to the old program will be replaced 
as new ones come available.

## Current Development Status

**Beta release: V1.0**

- 2016-08-10

  - Forked Release 1.0 of qDirStat after testing latest commit to fix qDirStat issue #22

    Cache files containing the root file system would not display correctly or
    segfault under certain conditions. This is now fixed.
